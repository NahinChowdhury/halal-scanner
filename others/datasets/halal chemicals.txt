                               FOOD INGREDIENT NUMBERS:
                                       (E-numbers)

 E numbers are number codes for food additives and are usually found on food labels throughout
 the European Union.

 The "E" stands for "Europe" or "European Union". Normally each food additive is assigned a
 unique number, though occasionally, related additives are given an extension ("a", "b", or "i",
 "ii") to another E-number.

 The numbering scheme follows that of the International Numbering System (INS) as
 determined by the Codex Alimentarius committee though only a subset of the INS additives is
 approved for use in the European Union.
